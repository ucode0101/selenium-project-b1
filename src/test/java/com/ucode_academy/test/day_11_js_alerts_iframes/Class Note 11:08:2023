Pop Up / Alert

What is alert/pop up?

Alert is smals message box/pop up which displays on screen notification to give
the user some kind of information or ask for permission to perform certain action
It may be also used for warning purpose

2 type of Alert:

1: HTML Alert, we just locate them using findElement() and click
2: JavaScript Alert.

There are 3 types of JavaScript alerts
1. Warning/information alert (you have one button only, just accept)
2. Confirmation alert (you have an option to say accept/decline)
3. Prompt alert (they ask something from you)

Syntax to Switch to Alert:

Alert alert = driver.swithchTo().alert();

alert.accept(); -> to accept the alert/warning. To click on OK button 
alert.dismis(); -> to cancel the alert/warning. To clcik on Cancel button lert.getText(); -> to get the text from that is displayed on alert/warning


How do you handle Java Sript Alerts?

You swith the driver to alert and user accept() or dismis() methods to accept/OK or cancel the allert.

There are two ways to handle JS Alerts:

1. Alert alert = driver.swithchTo().alert();
   And user any of the methods

You can switch to alert and handle it directly
2. driver.swithchTo().alert();

Iframe:

Iframe is  HTML inside another HTML.

HMTL main page can have multiple HTML pages, they are called iframe

The driver is in the main frame/parent frame by default, and cannot locate any web element which are in other iframes.

If we want  to locate the web element which is inside the iframe, we need to switch the driver to ifame first, and locate the web element

How to switch to iframe:

1. Locate the iframe like any other web element
  driver.switchTo().iframe(iframe);

2. To switch to iframe by index
  driver.switchTo().iframe(index);

3. To swithch to iframe by id (if it has id)
  driver.switchTo().iframe("id");

When we are in another frame we have to switch to main/parent frame by using:

driver.switchTo().parentFrame(); it goes one step up if you have nested frame
or
driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); it always goes to main frame from any frame


clear(); -> this method is used to clear existing text in the input field
        -> to remove/clear inputs from any input field

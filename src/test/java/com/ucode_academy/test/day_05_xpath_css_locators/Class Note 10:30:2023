Today's topic:
Xpath & CSS Locators

----------------------------------------------------

Xpath vs CSS Locators

xpath -> you can locate by text
CSS -> you cannot locate by text
xpat -> you can go forward and backward
CSS -> you can go only forward

CSS is faster than xpath

-------------------------------------------

When you try to locate the web element, ID is recommended, because it's usually uinque and it's faster.
---------------------------------------

Xpath -> you can create your own custom locator

Xpath is one of the locator that we use to locate web element 
it's usefull when web element is not unique, it allows to create a custom locators

Dynamic vs Static web elements

Dynamic web element -> when web element's value keeps changing
Static web element -> Web element's value does not change


Xpath types:
Absoloute and Relative 
When you use xpath, it's recommended to use Relative xpath, because Absolute xpath is not reliable


When we use xpath to locate web element * mean anywhere for example

//*[class='value1'] star (*) means any tag/any tag name here
It is not recommended to use * is you know the tag name

or 
//div[*='value2'] star(*) means any attribute/any attrubute name
It is not recommended to use * if you know the Attribute name


If you want to go to the following child
//div/h2

--------------------------------------------------------

isDisplayed(); -> This method is used to check if web element is visible on the page. It return boolean, if it's visible/displayed it return true else it returns false. First we need to locate the web element and use isDisplayed() method to and do some action based on condition

------------------------------------------------------------

Following syntax is used for locating elements containing exact text within an element
 text() -> this method is used to web element that has the matching text
 text() -> this is used insted of attribute without using @ sign

//TagName[text()=‘exact text’] 
  OR 
 dot (.) is exactly the same as using text() method
//TagName[.=‘exact text’]


If there are multiple tags inside one tag, they are called parent and child/children. And if we want to start from parent tag and go to the following child tag, we use single slash /
For exalmple //


How do you locate Dynamic Web elements?
Using contains, start-with or ends-with

Cotains is used when some part of the value doesn't change 
In bellow example it is used to locate web element with partial text

//TagName[contains(text(),‘matching text’)] -> It looks for matching text

We can also use it to locate web element with dynamic attribute value

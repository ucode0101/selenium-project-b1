Why do you use/need locators?
Before your selenium automation code can perform some action on the web page such click, enter some text, etc.., we need to find the web element using of 1 of 8 locators and then selenium can perfom some action on located web wlement

What is Web element?
Any thing that we see on the web page such links, button, inputs, text area



findElement(); -> this method is used to find and return a single web element
                  return type WebElement. If it does not find the web element, 
                  it will throw NoSuchElementException. If there are more than one web element, it will return the first one

Ex: WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("id"));


click(); -> this method is used to click on Web Element, like clicking with mouse

elment.click()



=================================================================


Locating web elemnt by ID is always recommanded becuase ID is usually unique for that specific web element


sendKeys("text"); -> this method String parameter and enter/type text in 
                     inpu/field/text are

ex: inputElement.sendKeys("text"); 


getText(); -> this method is used to get the text from web element  inner text ->
              ex: <a>text</a>


getAttribute("attribute"); -> this method takes attribute as a string, and
                          returns its value as a String. Return type is String
